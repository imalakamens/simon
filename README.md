Here I've created a version of  _**Simon**_, a game of memory skill, played by recognizing and repeating a given pattern. Originally [released in 1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)), Simon is a timeless classic - guaranteed to frustrate and amuse. Ready to try for yourself? Just: 

* Watch and remember the place and order of the random sequence generated by the program.
* Recreate the given pattern by selecting the appropriately colored button, or buttons, in the same order.
* Repeat those steps for as long as you can! If there's an incorrect input given, the game will restart from the beginning.

## Technologies Used
Javascript, CSS & HTML

## Next Steps
* I would like to add audio feedback for each of the buttons, as well as improve and polish styling. 
* Improve mobile compatibility(buttons do not light up when touched on a mobile device)
